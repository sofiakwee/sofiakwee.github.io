    <h2>Memories</h2>
  <p>One of my favorite memories was learning to surf in maui. There was a beach with the most amazing waves. My dad helped me get on a long board and pushed me into a wave. I stood up and it was the most amazing feeling. This inspired a lifetime love for the beach. since then I have been going to the beach every week. </p>
